## What's in here?

This repo contains pretrained models that predict relative upvotes on
Reddit for image-only and image + text models. The subreddits these
models were trained on are [/r/pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/),
[/r/aww](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/),
[/r/cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/),
[/r/FoodPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/),
[/r/MakeupAddiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/), and
[/r/RedditLaqueristas](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/),
so if you want to know if an image would probably be upvoted within
these communities, you've come to the right place! If you want to read
more about the technical details, check out the project page and paper
[here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jhessel/cats/cats.html).

## What is required to run this package?

To install requirements, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How do I score images?

If you want to score according to the /r/aww community

```
python score_example.py examples/bodhi.jpg aww
```

which outputs:
```
examples/bodhi.jpg		34.8/100
```

the first column is the filename, and the second column is the score
out of 100 for the image (higher is better). The score is the
percentile of the image's score on a test split.

## How do I score images plus their captions?

If you want to score a cat alongside a caption according to the
/r/cats community, you can do

```
python score_example.py examples/taz.jpg cats --caption "Please don't sit on me!"
```

which outputs
```
examples/taz.jpg		please dont sit on me		55.8/100
```

## How do I score lots of images/captions?

If you want to score many images/captions at once, you can use
`--list_mode True`; in this case, the image and caption arguments are
assumed to be text files. The image text file has one filename per
line, and the caption text file has one caption per line. The first
line of the image file should correspond to the first line of the
caption file, and so on. For example, you can run

```
python score_example.py examples/example_image_list.txt --caption examples/example_caption_list.txt cats --list_mode True
```

which outputs
```
examples/bodhi.jpg		who says bulldogs cant be c...	22.1/100
examples/lizzy.jpg            	my 20 year old little girl ...	99.4/100
examples/taz.jpg              	please dont sit on me         	55.8/100
```

Unsurprisingly, the model doesn't like a dog (Bodhi) being posted in
/r/cats, though the model likes the story about an elderly cat
(Lizzy). As an interesting experiment, you can check the effect the
captions had on the scores by running

```
python score_example.py examples/example_image_list.txt cats --list_mode True
```

and comparing to the previous output.

## I want to train my own models!

If you want to train your own models, you'll need to get the datasets
that these were trained on, which are not in this repo. They are
available for download
